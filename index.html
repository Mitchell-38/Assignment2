  <h3>KeepOut</h3>
  <p style="line-height:normal;">The project will be a collection of security programs and will serve as a secure hub of sorts containing a VPN, a password manager, an anti-virus, a secure web browser and a secure cloud based encrypted file storage. To begin with I&rsquo;m going to talk about account management.</p>
  <p style="line-height:normal;">Right off the bat it might seem counterintuitive to want a secure service to protect your privacy only to give it away to the person saying they can give you your privacy back but the account is only for 2 things. First it&rsquo;s there to identify you not personally only by email or username so that if you need to install it onto a new computer since the base program will be a one time purchase and will include everything but the cloud file storage however will have the structures to allow those competent to set up a local secure server and the expanded VPN servers that are more likely to get around a government or companies attempts to stop proxy&rsquo;s. The reason for this is because servers for both proxies and cloud file storage can get expensive very quickly and without constant cash flow from those that wish to use them the service would quickly sink. The password manager would be local or cloud based using Microsoft Azure with no extra charge but might implement a simple storage limit given that for the most part most people would only need a max of around 15 passwords and given that it&#39;s a choice not all will be comfortable having their passwords stored elsewhere. It will also have the ability to generate unique passwords itself that are made of random text made locally so that there is no worry about interception in any way. The VPN or Virtual Private Network functions as a proxy allowing you to essentially trick websites into thinking you&rsquo;re somewhere else which allows you to either get access to content you couldn&rsquo;t otherwise or stop your internet provider or someone intercepting your traffic from being able to see exactly what you do. The base version will include access to a few VPN servers in most countries that have modern internet infrastructure allowing access to content in other countries however being limited to a few servers means that it isn&rsquo;t too hard to be blocked by governments or companies. The subscription model will give access to constantly updated servers in an effort to avoid being blocked and allowing all content to be accessed and watched. The anti-virus will function like other market leaders providing from files or programs hidden in websites, emails or downloads that are likely to harm your computer. The base program will have the ability to scan your computer and quarantine and delete flagged items that it detects while the paid version will let you protect up to 5 computers with real-time flagging of spam or websites that are likely to contain malware as well as parental controls that will allow parents to easily set active hours for all apps or services such as internet as well as restrict some completely. It will also allow you to encrypt folders and work with the password manager to make sure that only you and those you want to share access to are able to get into these folders.</p>

	<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:16px">For our previous individual assignments, each team member had to complete three online personality tests:</p>
	<ul style="line-height:normal; font-size:16px">
		<li>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test</li>
		<li>Learning Style test</li>
		<li>A test of their own choosing</li>

	<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:16px;"> Mitchell’s interest in IT was not formed by a particular event or person; rather it was formed by a conglomeration of known figures and works both fictional and existent. Mitchell is a natural born Australian. He is interested in the problem solving and diagnostic aspects of programming, and potentially systems administration. In his spare time, Mitchell likes to read and look after his two pet rats. </p>
